/**
 * Keeping the block editor on for the Testimonials Block post type.
 *
 * A Testimonials Block post is not a document with a block in it. The post
 * type is registered with `template => [['bptmb/b-testimonials']]` and
 * `template_lock => 'all'`: the editing screen IS that one block, inserted
 * for you and not removable.
 *
 * So when a site has the block editor switched off, this screen does not
 * fall back to a simpler version of itself -- it falls back to an empty
 * TinyMCE box with a title above it and no way to build anything. Image
 * Gallery and Video Gallery hit the same problem (a real support report
 * against Video Gallery, on a site running Flatsome) and fixed it the same
 * way this file does: this post type's editor is forced back on, whatever a
 * "Classic Editor" plugin, a "Disable Gutenberg" plugin, or a theme option
 * decided for the rest of the site.
 *
